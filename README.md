# Rate Limiter testing

## Goals

The main goal of this project is demonstrate various rate limiting methods and progressively build and expand on the ability of the code to respond to high traffic levels.



## Components

The application as a whole is intended to run with a single command (docker-compose up is the initial goal) and demonstrate an example API, a rate limiter in front of said API, and an example load generator that is able to drive a test load with varying degrees of load.
